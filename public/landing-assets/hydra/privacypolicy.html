                    interact with our Site. By accessing our Site, you acknowledge and fully understand the Privacy

                    <strong><u>Information we collect and how we use it</u></strong><br/>
                    <br/>
                    When you use or connect to our Site through your computer or a mobile device, the owners and
                    publishers of the Site collect certain information from and about its users in a few ways, directly
                    from our web server logs, from you, with the aid of cookies, with web beacons, and through the use
                    of website analytics through a third-party service provider. We may collect personally identifiable
                    information necessary for internal marketing purposes based on user activity, registration and
                    billing from customers who purchase our products and services online.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    'Hydra&rsquo;s' proxy is a gateway for the user's network, and is set for the purposes of retrieving
                    such information, and base marketing material on it. We do not collect any sensitive information.

                    <br/>
                    Visitors to our Site can register to create an account, access the Site, download Software, and
                    possibly purchase services. When you register, we will request some personal information such as
                    your name, address, e-mail, telephone number or facsimile number, location, account number and other
                    relevant information. We also collect your IP computer address. If you are purchasing a service, we
                    will request financial information. Any financial information we collect is used only to bill you
                    for the services you purchased. If you purchase by credit card, this information may be forwarded to
                    your credit card provider. For other types of registrations, we will ask for the relevant
                    information. You may also be asked to disclose personal information to us so that we can provide
                    assistance and information to you. For example, such data may be warranted in order to provide
                    online technical support and troubleshooting.

                    <br/>
                    When you visit our Site, we may track information through web server logs to better administer the
                    Site and analyze its usage. Examples of information we may track include but is not limited to your
                    Internet Protocol address ("IP"), the type of bw-rowser or computer you use, the number of links you
                    click within the Site, the geographical location from which you accessed the Site, the date and time
                    of your visit, the name of your Internet service provider, any web pages you linked to our Site
                    from, and pages you viewed on the Site.

                    <strong><u>Use of cookies</u></strong><br/>
                    <br/>
                    'Hydra' may use cookies to personalize or enhance your user experience. A cookie is a small text
                    file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server to identify that specific user the next
                    time he or she visits the website. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your
                    computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web Server in the domain
                    that issued the cookie to you.

                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For
                    example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall
                    your specific information on subsequent visits. Hence, this simplifies the process of delivering
                    relevant content and eases site navigation by providing and saving your preferences and login
                    information as well as providing personalized functionality.

                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    We do not allow other companies on our Site to place cookies, unless there is a temporary overriding
                    of a part in the Site (such as integrating another site that relies on third-party cookies, into the
                    existing website).

                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    <strong><u>Modifying cookie settings</u></strong><br/>
                    <br/>
                    You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web bw-rowsers automatically accept cookies,
                    but you can usually modify your bw-rowser setting to delete or decline cookies. If you reject
                    cookies by changing your bw-rowser settings then be aware that this may disable some of the
                    functionality on our Site.

                    <strong><u>Use of web beacons or GIF files</u></strong><br/>
                    <br/>
                    This Site may contain electronic images known as "Web Beacons" (also called single-pixel GIFs) that
                    allow the owners and publishers of the Site to count users who have visited those pages and to
                    deliver certain services. The owners and publishers of the Site may include Web Beacons in
                    promotional e-mail messages or newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened
                    and acted upon.

                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Some Web Beacons may be placed by third-party service providers to help us determine the
                    effectiveness of our advertising campaigns or e-mail communications. These Web Beacons may be used
                    by these service providers to place a persistent cookie on your computer, for the benefit of
                    'Hydra'. This allows the service provider to recognize your computer each time you visit certain
                    pages or e-mails and compiles anonymous information in relation to those page views, which in turn
                    enables us and our service providers to learn which advertisements and e-mails bring you to our
                    website and how you use the Site. 'Hydra's' Web Beacons are not used to collect or access your
                    identifying personal information.

                    identifying personal information to third-party companies. Personal User information collected by or
                    submitted to 'Hydra' shall not be disclosed to any third-parties without your permission, unless

                    regulation, legal process, law enforcement or government regulatory authorities, in which case we
                    shall give you as much advance notice as is reasonably practicable in order to allow you to limit or
                    restrict to such disclosure; or (iii) is required to be disclosed in order for us to protect our
                    legal rights or defend against liability; or (iv) in connection with a merger, acquisition, or
