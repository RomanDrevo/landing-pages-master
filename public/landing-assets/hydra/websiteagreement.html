                    <br/>
                    The Parties will attempt in good faith to negotiate a settlement to any claim or dispute between
                    them arising out of or in connection with this Agreement. If the parties fail to agree upon terms of
                    settlement, either side may submit the dispute to confidential arbitration proceedings by a sole
                    arbitrator under the ICC ADR Rules, whose decision shall be final and binding. The arbitration
                    proceedings shall be conducted in English, in London, UK or another place agreed by all Parties.
                    Without derogating of the provisions above, this clause explicitly sets exclusive jurisdiction to
                    said arbitration process, and neither Party shall be entitled to submit any dispute to the courts of
                    its domicile which contradicts said arbitration process.

                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong><u>17. Miscellaneous</u></strong> You agree that these Terms of Service are for the benefit
                    of the User and <em>'Hydra'</em>. Therefore, these Terms are personal to you and not assignable. No
                    joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and
                    <em>'Hydra'</em> as a result of these Terms of Service or arising out of your use of the Website.
                    <em>'Hydra'</em>s failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of this
                    Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right under these Terms of Service
                    or at law. <em>'Hydra'</em> may assign its rights and duties under this Agreement to any party and
                    at any time, without notice to the User. These Terms of Service, along with <em>'Hydra&rsquo;s'</em>
                    Privacy Policy, represent the entire agreement between You and <em>'Hydra'</em> with respect to use
                    of the Website, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether
                    electronic, oral, or written between You and HYDRA.

                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong><u>18. Severability</u></strong> If any provision of these Terms of Service is ruled invalid
                    or otherwise unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, or on account of a conflict with an
                    applicable government regulation, such determination shall not affect the remaining provisions (or
                    parts thereof) contained herein. Any invalid or unenforceable portion should be construed as amended
                    in order to achieve as closely as possible the same effect as the Terms of Service as original
                    drafted.
