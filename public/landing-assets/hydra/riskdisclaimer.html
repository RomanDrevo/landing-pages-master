                <p>
                    <em>'Hydra'</em> (<em>'Hydra'</em>) allows its users (hereinafter: "<strong>User</strong>" or
                    "<strong>Users</strong>") to trade in highly speculative investments which involve a significant
                    risk of loss. Such trading is not suitable for all investors so Users must ensure that Users fully
                    understand the risks before trading. <em>'Hydra'</em> does not manage, or offer any legal, tax,
                    accounting or investment advice advice, or recommendation regarding suitability, profitability,
                    investment strategy or other matter.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All Users and prospective Users should read carefully the following risk disclosure and warnings
                    contained in this document, before applying to <em>'Hydra'</em> to use its software and before
                    beginning to trade in various financial instruments. However, it is noted that this document cannot
                    and does not disclose or explain all of the risks and other significant aspects involved in dealing
                    in Binary Options. The notice was designed to explain in general terms the nature of the risks
                    involved when dealing in Binary Options in a fair and non-misleading way.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>DUE TO THE HIGH RISK NATURE OF TRADING, <em>'Hydra'</em> EXPLICITLY DOES NOT MAKE ANY
                        EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR GUARANTEES THAT USERS WILL MAKE ANY PROFIT OR THAT USERS WILL
                        NOT LOSE ANY OR <u>ALL</u> DEPOSITED INVESTMENT FUNDS.</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Trading in Binary Options is VERY SPECULATIVE AND HIGHLY RISKY and is not suitable for all members
                    of the general public, but only for those investors who:<br/>
                    <br/>
                    (a) Understand and are willing to assume the economic, legal and other risks involved.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    (b) Take into account their personal financial circumstances, financial resources, life style and
                    obligations are financially able to assume the loss of their entire investment.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    (c) Have the knowledge to understand Binary Options trading and the underlying assets and
                    markets.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    'Hydra' will not provide Users with any advice relating to Binary Options, the underlying assets and
                    markets or make investment recommendations of any kind. So, if User does not understand the risks
                    involved, he should seek advice and consultation from an independent financial advisor. If User
                    still does not understand the risks involved in trading in Binary Options then he should not trade
                    at all.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Binary Options are derivative financial instruments deriving their value from the prices of the
                    underlying assets/markets to which they refer (for example: currencies, equity indices, stocks,
                    metals, indices futures, forwards, etc.). It is important, therefore, that User understands the
                    risks associated with trading in the relevant underlying asset/market because fluctuations in the
                    price of the underlying asset/market will affect the profitability of his trade.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    <u>Some such risks include</u><br/>
                    <br/>
                    Volatility - movements in the price of underlying assets/markets can be volatile and unpredictable.
                    This will have a direct impact on User's profits and losses. Understanding the volatility of an
                    underlying market will help guide User regarding how to trade and how much he is willing to
                    lose.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Market swings - a swing is a sudden shift in the price of an underlying asset price from one level
                    to another. Various factors can lead to gapping (for example, economic events or market
                    announcements) and gapping can occur both when the underlying market is open and when it is closed.
                    When these factors occur while the underlying market is closed, the price of the underlying market
                    when it reopens (and therefore our derived price) can be markedly different from the closing price,
                    with no opportunity to close your trade in-between. 'Gapping' can result in a significant loss (or
                    profit).<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Market liquidity - The prices of Binary Options will be influenced by, amongst other things,
                    changing supply and demand relationships, governmental, agricultural, commercial and trade programs
                    and policies, national and international political and economic events and the prevailing
                    psychological characteristics of the relevant market place and some of the Binary Options'
                    underlying assets may not become immediately liquid as a result of reduced demand for the underlying
                    asset. So, market conditions can change significantly in a very short period of time and hence,
                    under certain market conditions, it may be impossible for User's order to be executed, leading to
                    losses.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    It is understood that when it comes to trading in currencies, there may be situations, movements
                    and/or conditions occurring at weekend, in the beginning of week or intra-day after release of
                    significant macroeconomic figures, economic or political news that make currency markets to open
                    with price levels that may substantially differ from previous prices.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    *HIGH RISK INVESTMENT WARNING*
                    <br/>
                    Trading Binary Options involve a risk of losing your investment. This Risk Warning Notice cannot and
                    does not disclose all the risks and other significant aspects of option and derivative trading. You
                    should not speculate with capital that you cannot afford to lose. We strongly suggest you read
