            check your local regulations before trading online.</p>

        <h3>Hyperlinks and third parties:</h3>
        <p>www.thequantumcodes.trade has not reviewed and accepts no responsibility for any information on any other
            website that you access by a hyperlink from this site, or for information on other websites that you came to

            or any information contained on that site.</p>

        <h3>Risks inherent in trading through the internet:</h3>
        <p>Binary options are options that pay a pre-determined, fixed amount, depending on whether or not an event
            occurs at the time the Contract expires. Because Binary Options can have only one of two possible outcomes,
            they allow a simple “Yes or No” approach.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Like traditional options, Binary Options are based on an underlying asset such as currencies, commodities,
            indexes or stocks, however one of the most significant differences from traditional options, among others,
            is that there can be only two outcomes for the option, either the client is paid the return upon the
            occurrence of the event, or the client loses the investment amount.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Trading in Binary Options is speculative and involves a high degree of risk and can result in the loss of
            your entire investment. Therefore, trading in Binary Options is appropriate only for persons who understand
            and are willing to assume the economic, legal and other risks involved in such transactions.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            You should be satisfied that Binary Options trading is suitable for you in light of your financial
            circumstances and attitude towards risk. You should not engage in speculative Binary Options trading unless
            you understand the basic aspects of such trading and its risks. If you are in any doubt as to whether Binary
            Option trading is appropriate and suitable for you, please seek independent advice from a financial
            consulting professional, as www.thequantumcodes.trade does not provide such advice.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            It is the Client’s responsibility, taking into account his personal circumstances and financial resources,
            to take particular care and make careful considerations independently, both prior to applying for engaging
            in Binary Options with www.thequantumcodes.trade and our selected brokers and prior to making any
            individual order.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Where the Client does not understand the risks involved in applying for a trading account with the Company
            or in making any individual order, the Client should seek advice and consultation from an independent
            Financial Advisor. If the Client continues to not understand the risks involved in trading in Binary
            Options, the Client should not trade at all.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            You are advised that the Binary Options offered by our selected brokers are not always traded under the
            rules of any recognized, designated or regulated exchange.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Consequently, engaging in Binary Option trading may expose you to substantially greater risks than
            investments which are so traded.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The Client must acknowledge that engaging in Binary Options poses a great risk of incurring losses and the
            Client must accept that he is willing to undertake this risk.</p>
